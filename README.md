# Machine-Learning (Python for AI)
**INTRODUCTION**
Python language used in the context of machine learning and more specifically how we can use this to build predictions using regression, clustering and classification.

**Data Preparation*

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split (PREPARES YOUR DATA)
-- to prepare, clean and split the dataset into separate subsets so that the model can learn form ONE PORTION and be TESTED on another. This step ensures No Data Leakage, reliable evaluation of real-world performance and balanced representation of distribution

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression (BUILDS AND TRAINS YOUR MODEL)
-- this is where the "learning" in machine learning actual happens. To teach the model to understand relationships between input features (X) and target values (y). This step is about Minimising the Error between predicted and actual values.

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, accuracy_score (ASSESSES HOW GOOD YOUR MODEL IS)
-- this measure how accurately or effectively the trained model performs on UNSEEN data. This ensures if model generalises well, whether it Overfits or Underfits. Without evaluation, the model accuracy is meaningless.
